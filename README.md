Developing my portfolio was an instructive and difficult task that enabled me to improve my technical and design skills.
One of the challenges I encountered was maintaining the layout organized and well-structured. 
At the start, the site looked disorganized, with inconsistent typography and spacing that rendered the content difficult to read. 
To correct this, I used a grid layout, cleaned-up font selections, and proper alignment.
These modifications made the visual hierarchy clearer, enhancing legibility and presentation.‎Another major hurdle was getting the portfolio responsive on various devices.
Initially, some components were not correctly resizing on mobile devices, which made the viewing experience less than ideal. 
To correct this, I employed CSS flexbox and media queries, enabling the design to transition effortlessly to desktops, tablets, and smartphones. 
Accessibility was also a concern; I included descriptive alt text for pictures and enhanced color contrast to make the site accessible to more individuals. ‎
I also learned how beneficial it is to eliminate unnecessary complexity. By making navigation easier, utilizing brief and concise text, and incorporating visible calls-to-action,
I was able to increase the usability of the site. In the future, I intend to further enhance the portfolio by adding interactive aspects such as animations or hover effects to create increased engagement.
I also intend to add more project entries, a downloadable resume, and potentially a blog to highlight on-going work and learning.
Overall, this project highlighted the need to integrate design, usability, and accessibility to produce a refined professional portfolio.
